No further negative comments about Spotify are made in this document.

initial searches send spotify into an infinite loop or timeout i often have to close the app and restart it to make it functional searches arent comprehensive or accurate either taking off one star because despite all the updates and superficial gloss it is still feeling dated oh and also because there is no chromecast support  major booboo for me  like it especially public playlists but spotify", "ive had spotify for a couple years now and just recently ive had issues with it where the music will stop playing between songs it happened randomly whether my phone screen was on or off i had to reopen the app for the next song to continue i contacted spotify and posted on the spotify community with miserable results their helpdesk were unhelpful other users on the community were able to find a solution albeit backwards rather than spotify themselves ive installed an older version of spotify", "best streaming service available i was a deezer user for many years hesitating to jump to spotify i cannot be more happy with spotify now it works with all my google and alexa environment my car etc i bought the family plan and it is a good deal the only downside i have found is the need of having a separate userlicense in the google and alexa devices at home so my kids can use it independently if i link my user it keeps stopping my music in my cellpc when kids use it at home", "i have been using spotify for years  since it first came out really on the computer and then i followed it to the app i pay  every month to get access to the music i love while driving without ads  i loved not being able to worry about song coming on i didnt want to listen to but with this recent update the app has turned to hell songs pause multiple times like a track skipping on a cd and the layout is horrible the last layout was beautiful i want that one back", "i love spotify but lately i have been having some problems with actually listening to what i am playing on speakers i can listen but on the actual device i cant i have tried logging out and signing back in deleting the app and reinstalling it multiple times and it still doesnt work reading a lot of these reviews got me thinking that spotify has a problem with its app on android devices i hope they improve", "charged me   and i was glad to pay for it for  monthsi had it for one monthi tried to charge me again for another three months and they claimed and i quoteyou have not paid for your original  months im sorry i dont know what to say which is a load of bs because i have credit card charges on my phone and my credit card for free months of spotify and it states that i have paid  for it and somehow they dont have a way to communicate with each other via telephone to figure this problem out i strongly go against you getting premium for anybody who tries to buy this out or even download it because theyre just going to keep you out and steal your money if i could i would sue them but im not going to because its going to be such a pain in the butt and create a bigger hassle just next time i wish that they would just be more mature and man up to the fact that i do know what im talking about when i say that i spent the money", "hey guys this is the worst music player ever it tells you to pay to listen to music offline and stuff but heres the thing this is the app i have been using for awhile and its way better then spotify and its free you can listen to music offline for free and its basically youtube but music basically you can listen to any song you like its called mp player which stands for free music its the rainbow coloured app trust me this is way better then spotify", "few months ago i was in love with spotify until i met their free trial after the trial period expired they started to cut off everything i love about it one by one starting from not more than  skips per day to streaming in lower qualities seriously just cuz i dont pay for the music which i did not download", "why cant i preview songs anymore do i really have to pay  to listen to a snippet of songs i may not even like really spotify really is cutting us off at the knee this is ridiculous ive used this app for years and every update just gets worse and worse i may have to look for a different streaming service if this isnt fixed the numerous looping ads are intrusive enough as it is but this takes the cake", "i love music so much i love you spotifiy i love it so much thats how i sleep you guys are the best i love you so much stay aseowme stay sweet and dont forget i love you bye spotify time for music bye for more", "its pretty dope and i prefer using spotifys premium service as opposed to taking up space on my phone transferring songs i still keep my old ipod around because there are things i cant find but i was still shocked on the huge selection that spotify has to offer", "i love driving for a few hours without having to juggle cds or have a memory stick its great how all your favourites are in one folder and often other foldersoptions are available ive been able to find songs i havent heard for decades upgrading was the best way to get rid of the ads love spotify", "i use both spotify and pandora and ive been a little displeased by jow many ads spotify has i know why they have ads in general thats not my issue my issue is with how many there are two or three songs will play then i have to sit and listen to two or three ads in a row then a couple more songs play rinse and repeat i know ads are both revenue bringers and an encouragement to go premium but the amount of ads for the free service at least for me is rather annoying i grew up listenig to amfm radio so im not unused to long commercial breaks but when comparing it to my experience with pandora pandora tops spotify in many areas especially in length of uninterrupted listening variety of playlists and simplicity of use yes in spotify you can create your own custom lists and play the songs you want instead of what the app brings up for you like in pandora and with premium you can download the songs and have it all ad free but i dont pay for premium so comparing the two ive had much better success with pandora the gui is smoother the resource draw is less measured with cpuz and it streams much more consistently i love spotify on my desktop and my laptop but when it comes to mobile the free service falls flat in comparison to pandora just my personal experience", "in recent updates the media player bar itself is completely broken both in app and in my notifications area on my note u g a soft reset of my phone does fix it temporarily but it always occurs again within a couple days sure its a small inconvenience but this actually completely ruins music control songs dont continuous play i cant control spotify from my watch when it happens and i cant kill audio without killing the whole app fix pls very inconvenient at times", "to anyone thats been having force quit issues please try this uninstall the app and clear storage caches restart your phone go into your sd card and go to android file folder search for spotify if you have a search option find old cached files and delete them restart phone and reinstall spotify"], "test_settings": "chunk:200_embeddings:jina-embeddings-v2-base-en_rerank:False_reader-model:HuggingFaceH4~zephyr-7b-beta",
