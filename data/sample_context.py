REVIEW_SAMPLE = ['buggier all the time wont recognize that im playing music on the kitchen dot when i just clicked play from the app one song ago tons of issues with changing speakers skipping forward and back on podcasts is completely messed up doesnt skip in the right direction or increments anymore user since the very beginning but having to reconsider continuing to use the service the only thing that has kept me this far are the playlists theirs and mine i dont want to lose',
 'i have been using this app for years until you changed it to where i have to go premium just to listen to my playlists without shuffle overall im not happy with the recent updates',
 'can no longer stream files that are originally from a local source artist \nand album links also no longer work nearly every song has a matching one \nthat can be streamedbut the lookup that previously connected them which \nallowed streaming seems to have been removed has basically rendered my \nhand picked  track playlist useless unless played from the computer \nholding the main library as a paying member for the last  years the \nconstant updates which have been silently removing or eroding features \nsuch as this and others such as release notifications is very \ndisappointing am now considering moving to an alternative service',
 'a very good music app  where u can find any type of music  all free thats what i like  keep the good work spotify team  btw this is the longest review i have given to any app ',
 'last update has caused havok with my note  ultra if i search for a song and play it doest match my track now playing info at the bottom of the screen which is still a previous track ive played i can select any song on spotify and it will not update the only way to update this info is to force stop then try again',
 'i gave it  stars only for the good content the app is bugged i dont have the canvas option in my account  i am unable to make payments  i am unable to share my playlists i am to join premium family accounts first spotify was good now its bugged bugged and buggged ',
 'i have been using it for more than a year now using another email id i just moved to the uka and hence i had to cancel my premium subscription and change the address after the billing month then subscribe again after changing address its such a regressive and old school system you should really make it more userfriendly and the best part like with many new small companies they do not have a helpsupport system its just a bunch of easy questions with easy answers thanks a lot ive been trying to add my wife to the family subscription for an hour now and no use no help too',
 'i did not like the way the app pushed politics on their platform however there is no other app close to this useful',
 'boss even with advertising simple to use ive tried to catch it out with older s music  but never have yet well done spotify',
 'nice app but after using it for  or  months it becomes very annoying and later if you use this app offline it shows no internet connection',
 'while i enjoy spotify im not a fan that theyve removed the heart function its now an extra step to add music to my liked playlist and it removes a quick way for me to see what songs on other playlists ive listened to to help gauge whether the rest of the music would be something id enjoy wish i didnt have auto updates on because this is frustrating anyone know how to forcechange it back',
 'i enjoyed it when it was functioning well today idk what happened i wss editing my playlist so it could be neat but i cant edit it anymore i didnt even know that your own premuim account have a deadline but atleast fix this i cant even play full musics anymore like what the heck you can put ads on it but why couldnt i fix it yall need to do somethin about this might aswell download all this music that i found rather than being stress about this',
 'loved spotify mostly until i had to see drakes shoddy face on everything \nwith no way to opt out i pay so i dont have to deal with excessive \nintrusive and obnoxious advertising not so that some artist i dont care \nabout can be shoved in my face',
 'actually ive been playing on this music platform for  years i know that this platform is best for work study etc but now why do i suddenly banned from yours when im trying to get into with my account my password either didnt recognized nor cant even access through the main menu because of that please help me spotify its supposedly not to make it inconvenient but i need some serious action to get back into the main menu by my last account so that i can spend more time with your songs',
 'ive been using this app for years and have spotify premium but for the past month or two the app has been running horribly when you skip a song it just keeps playing the original and then when you tap pause it doesnt pause until i force close the app and it keeps playing the music the only way i have found to solve this is to restart my phone every time the problem happens which it is a huge pain sometimes the app wont load anything when you open it either itll just be a blank screen and during the playing of a song it will stop for sometimes up to a minute and then continue this is on a samsung galaxy s active']
